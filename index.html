        <h2>User eXperience Design Notes</h2>
        <span id="sp_block_1">
            <h2>Strategy Plain(Block 1)</h2>
            <p>Strategy incorporates user needs as well as product objectives. Therefore, the best time to start using
                the Five Planes method is in parallel or following the user research phase in any design process.
                Fundamentally, the strategy must answer two questions:
                Why do we want to build the product?
                What are the needs of our users and how do we address them?
                Take for example an app that allows people to book a taxi on-demand. In this example, some of the
                strategic objectives are quite obvious: Users want to travel from point A to B, and the taxi company
                wants to earn the traveller’s business.</p>
        </span>

        <span id="sp_block_2">
            <h2>Scope Plain</h2>
            <p>Scope is guided by the product strategy. Here, we explore what features and functions are within scope,
                as well as what content elements may be required to meet users needs. Going back to our taxi example, the
                app might offer a feature that allows users to set a ‘home’ and ‘work’ location to make it easy to call a
                taxi to frequently used location. The question of whether that feature — or any other feature — is included
                on a site is a question of scope.</p>
        </span>
        <br>
        <span id="sp_block_3">   
            <h2>Structure Plain</h2>
                <p>Structure defines how the various features and functions fit together. Here we start transitioning from the
            abstract to more concrete elements of the user experience. Structure deals with defining how users get to
            specific information and where they can go next.
            Whereas skeleton, the next plane, might define the arrangement of navigational objects allowing users to
            select their ‘ride’, structure defines the categories of trips or rides possible.</p>
            <h2>Skeleton Plain</h2>
        </span>
        <span id="sp_block_4">
            <p>Skeleton is the concrete expression of the more abstract structure of the site. Here we start designing
            interface elements — buttons, text blocks, images, etc. — that will facilitate the user’s understanding and
            movement through the product.
            The skeleton, that often materializes in the form of a wireframe or a low-fidelity prototype, is designed to
            optimize the arrangement of UI elements for efficiency and ease of use. For example, back in our taxi app
            example, it might be determined that a map would show the location of the nearest vehicles and a prominent
            button would allow the user to confirm their ride.</p>
        <span id="sp_block_5">
            <h2>Surface Plain</h2>
        <p>
            Surface is the ‘skin’ layer of the product. Here, designers dive into the visual treatment of the product,
            including text, graphical elements, and navigational components to create the packaging, the final
            ‘look-and-feel’, of the product.
            Surface level design is often what most people will refer to when talking about the product. For some, the
            packaging is what triggers feelings and emotions that will lead them to choose one taxi app over another.
